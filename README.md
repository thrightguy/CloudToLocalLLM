*   **`build`**: Incremental build number for CI/CD.

This allows for precise tracking of releases and development builds.
For detailed information, see [Versioning Strategy](docs/DEPLOYMENT/VERSIONING_STRATEGY.md).

## üöÄ Deployment

### Multi-Container Deployment (Recommended for Self-Hosting)
<!-- The script `scripts/deploy/update_and_deploy.sh` is used for deploying the multi-container setup to a VPS. Higher-level scripts like `scripts/deploy/complete_automated_deployment.sh` may orchestrate this. -->
Deploy the full CloudToLocalLLM stack to your own Virtual Private Server (VPS) using Docker Compose.
```bash
# Example: Navigate to project root and run deployment script
cd /path/to/CloudToLocalLLM
./scripts/deploy/update_and_deploy.sh --force
# For a more automated deployment, consider scripts like ./scripts/deploy/complete_automated_deployment.sh
```
This setup provides a scalable and secure environment for multiple users. See `docs/OPERATIONS/SELF_HOSTING.md` for detailed instructions.

### Legacy Single Container (Deprecated)
The legacy single-container deployment is deprecated and no longer supported. Please migrate to the multi-container architecture.

## Development Workflow

CloudToLocalLLM includes automated development workflow tools to streamline the development process:

### Quick Development Push

When you've completed development work and documentation, use the quick push script:

```bash
# Auto-commit and push with generated message
.\push-dev.ps1

# Custom commit message
.\push-dev.ps1 -m "Complete zrok service implementation"

# Preview changes without committing
.\push-dev.ps1 -dry

# Force push (skip validation)
.\push-dev.ps1 -f
```

### Automated Development Workflow

For comprehensive development workflow automation:

```bash
# Complete workflow with validation
.\scripts\powershell\Complete-DevWorkflow.ps1

# Skip static analysis
.\scripts\powershell\Complete-DevWorkflow.ps1 -SkipAnalysis

# Create development release
.\scripts\powershell\Complete-DevWorkflow.ps1 -CreateDevRelease
```

### Development Standards

The automated workflow enforces:
- ‚úÖ Flutter analyze with zero issues
- ‚úÖ PSScriptAnalyzer compliance for PowerShell scripts
- ‚úÖ Documentation completeness validation
- ‚úÖ Platform abstraction pattern compliance
- ‚úÖ Automatic commit message generation based on changes

### Git Hooks (Optional)

Install Git hooks for automatic push when documentation is complete:

```bash
# Copy post-commit hook
Copy-Item scripts/git-hooks/post-commit .git/hooks/post-commit -Force

# Make executable (Linux/macOS)
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
```

This ensures that commits are automatically pushed when documentation markers are present.

## üì¶ Building Client Applications

Instructions for building and packaging client applications for different platforms:

### Linux (General Static Package)
Uses `scripts/build_unified_package.sh`. This script typically:
1.  Builds the Flutter application in release mode.
2.  Copies necessary assets and libraries.
3.  Creates a distributable archive (e.g., `.tar.gz`).
```bash
./scripts/build_unified_package.sh
```
The output will be in the `dist/` directory.

### Linux (AUR Package) - REMOVED
**AUR support has been decommissioned** and is no longer available.

**Alternative Linux Distribution Methods**:
- **DEB Package**: Use `scripts/packaging/build_deb.sh`
- **AppImage**: Use `scripts/packaging/build_appimage.sh`
- **Flatpak**: Use `scripts/packaging/build_flatpak.sh` (if available)

**Recommended for Linux**:
```bash
# Build DEB package for Debian/Ubuntu systems
./scripts/packaging/build_deb.sh
```

The DEB package provides:
- Native package management integration
- Automatic dependency handling
- System service integration
- Desktop environment integration

### Windows
**Status**: Available (v3.6.0+)

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) for local LLM support.
