# Onboarding Summary: CloudToLocalLLM

Welcome to the CloudToLocalLLM project! This document provides a comprehensive summary to help new developers get up to speed quickly.

## 1. Introduction

CloudToLocalLLM bridges the gap between powerful cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs) and the privacy and control of local execution. It offers a seamless, multi-tenant experience for interacting with local LLMs via a sophisticated cloud-hosted web interface and a robust, unified Flutter-native system tray application.

## 3. New Developer Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment and start contributing.

### Step 1: Prerequisites
*   **Flutter SDK:** Version 3.8.0 or later.
*   **Git:** For version control.
*   **Ollama:** Installed and running locally for LLM interaction.
*   **IDE:** VS Code (recommended) or Android Studio.

### Step 2: Environment Setup
1.  **Fork & Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    # Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CloudToLocalLLM.git
    cd CloudToLocalLLM
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies & Configure Flutter:**
    ```bash
    # Install Flutter package dependencies
    flutter pub get

    # Enable desktop support (run for your target platform)
    flutter config --enable-linux-desktop
    flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
    flutter config --enable-macos-desktop
    ```

3.  **Verify Setup:**
