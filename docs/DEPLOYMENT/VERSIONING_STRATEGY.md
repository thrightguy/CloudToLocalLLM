# CloudToLocalLLM Versioning Strategy

## Overview

CloudToLocalLLM follows a strict semantic versioning scheme that aligns release types with deployment urgency and testing requirements. This strategy ensures appropriate prioritization of different types of changes and helps teams understand the impact and urgency of each release.

## Semantic Versioning Format

**Format:** `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH+YYYYMMDDHHMM`

- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**: Semantic version following semver.org standards
- **YYYYMMDDHHMM**: Build timestamp in 12-digit format (Year-Month-Day-Hour-Minute)

**Example:** `3.5.14+202506172035` = Version 3.5.14 built on June 17, 2025 at 20:35

## Release Type Classifications

## Version Management Commands

### Using the Version Manager Script

```bash
# Show current version information
./scripts/version_manager.sh info

# Manual version increment (AFTER deployment verification)
./scripts/powershell/version_manager.ps1 increment patch    # For urgent fixes
./scripts/powershell/version_manager.ps1 increment minor    # For planned features
./scripts/powershell/version_manager.ps1 increment major    # For breaking changes
./scripts/powershell/version_manager.ps1 increment build    # For timestamp updates

# Prepare versions for build-time injection (during deployment)
./scripts/version_manager.sh prepare patch      # Prepare with placeholder
./scripts/version_manager.sh prepare minor      # Build-time timestamp injection
```

### Decision Matrix

| Change Type | Version Increment | Deployment Urgency | Testing Level | Example |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| Critical Bug Fix | PATCH | Immediate | Minimal | Login failure fix |
| Security Vulnerability | PATCH | Immediate | Security-focused | Auth bypass patch |
| New Feature | MINOR | Planned | Full | Tunnel management UI |
| UI Enhancement | MINOR | Planned | Full | Settings redesign |
| Breaking API Change | MAJOR | Planned | Comprehensive | API v2 migration |
| Framework Upgrade | MAJOR | Planned | Comprehensive | Flutter 4.0 |

## Deployment Workflow Integration

### Manual Version Increment Strategy

**Version incrementing is now performed AFTER deployment verification** to give developers control over when versions are committed.

#### **New Workflow:**
1. **Deploy Current Version**: Use existing version for deployment
2. **Verify Deployment**: Ensure all components are working correctly
3. **Manual Version Increment**: Choose appropriate increment type
4. **Commit Version Changes**: Prepare repository for next development cycle

#### **Version Increment Commands (Post-Deployment):**
```powershell
# After successful deployment verification
./scripts/powershell/version_manager.ps1 increment patch    # For bug fixes
./scripts/powershell/version_manager.ps1 increment minor    # For new features
./scripts/powershell/version_manager.ps1 increment major    # For breaking changes

# Commit the version increment
git add . && git commit -m "Increment version after deployment" && git push
```

### 6-Phase Deployment Considerations

**PATCH Releases:**
- **Phase 1-3**: Expedited execution
- **Phase 4**: Minimal distribution testing
- **Phase 5**: Immediate VPS deployment
- **Phase 6**: Fast-track verification
- **Post-Deployment**: Verify fixes, then manually increment patch version

**MINOR Releases:**
- **Phase 1-3**: Standard execution
- **Phase 4**: Full distribution testing
- **Phase 5**: Scheduled VPS deployment
- **Phase 6**: Complete verification including AUR testing
- **Post-Deployment**: Verify features, then manually increment minor version

**MAJOR Releases:**
- **Phase 1-3**: Extended testing and validation
- **Phase 4**: Comprehensive distribution testing
- **Phase 5**: Coordinated VPS deployment with rollback plan
- **Phase 6**: Extended verification and monitoring
- **Post-Deployment**: Verify compatibility, then manually increment major version

## GitHub Release Strategy

### Automatic GitHub Releases

**MAJOR versions only** (X.0.0) automatically trigger GitHub release creation:

```bash
# Major version increment automatically suggests GitHub release
./scripts/version_manager.sh increment major
# Output: "This is a MAJOR version update - GitHub release should be created!"
# Output: "Run: git tag v3.0.0 && git push origin v3.0.0"
```

**MINOR and PATCH versions** do not create GitHub releases to avoid release noise.

## Best Practices

### Version Selection Guidelines

1. **Ask: "Is this change breaking existing functionality?"**
   - Yes ‚Üí MAJOR release
   - No ‚Üí Continue to next question

2. **Ask: "Is this an urgent fix that can't wait?"**
   - Yes ‚Üí PATCH release
   - No ‚Üí Continue to next question

3. **Ask: "Does this add new functionality or features?"**
   - Yes ‚Üí MINOR release
   - No ‚Üí BUILD update

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Using PATCH for planned features**
- Patch releases should be reserved for urgent fixes only

‚ùå **Using MINOR for breaking changes**
- Breaking changes always require MAJOR version increment

‚ùå **Creating GitHub releases for every version**
- Only MAJOR versions warrant GitHub releases

‚ùå **Inconsistent versioning across team**
- Use the version manager script to ensure consistency

### Emergency Hotfix Process

1. **Identify Critical Issue**: Confirm issue requires immediate fix
2. **Create Hotfix Branch**: `git checkout -b hotfix/critical-auth-fix`
3. **Implement Fix**: Minimal code changes to address issue
4. **Fast-Track Testing**: Focus on fix verification only
5. **Deploy Immediately**: Use expedited 6-phase deployment with current version
6. **Verify Fix**: Ensure hotfix resolves the critical issue
7. **Manual Version Increment**: `./scripts/powershell/version_manager.ps1 increment patch`
8. **Commit Version**: `git add . && git commit -m "Increment version after hotfix" && git push`
9. **Monitor Closely**: Enhanced monitoring post-deployment
